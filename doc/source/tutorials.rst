Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are for people who have never used Newton before. The examples
are as minimalistic as possible for the task at hand. Instead of Makefiles you
will need to type the compile command. Instead of 3D visualisations there will
only be `printf` statements - you have been warned :)

The tutorials were developed on Kubuntu 16.04, but should run on all platforms
supported by Newton.
